# Overview

Welcome to the xAtom framework's API reference, thoughtfully designed to empower developers with a comprehensive set of APIs for building robust web applications. In the **Components** category, you'll find versatile APIs like **WFComponent**, enabling the conversion of HTML elements into interactive components with extensive control over styling and content updates. **WFDynamicList** streamlines the creation of dynamic listings with functional capabilities, while **WFFormComponent** simplifies complex form flows. **WFInvisibleForm** allows form submissions without any visible form elements.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
```

```mdx-code-block

<DocCardList items={[{
          type: "category",
          label: "Components",
          description:"💡 Create interactive elements effortlessly.",
          items: [{
          type:"link",
          href:"/docs/guide/reference/components/WFComponent",
          label:"",
        }],
        }
        ]} ></DocCardList>

```

In the realm of **Routing**, **WFRoute** provides granular control over routing, allowing you to designate routes as protected or public to enhance the security of your web apps. **Authentication** is a breeze with **WFAuth**, offering a blueprint for implementing user authentication, and **WFAuthMiddleware**, seamlessly integrating authentication middleware into your application.

```mdx-code-block

<DocCardList items={[
        {
          type: "category",
          label: "Routing",
          description:"🚀 Total control over navigation",

        },{
          type: "category",
          label: "Authentication",
          description:"🔒 Strengthening web app security",
          items: [{

        }],
        }
        ]} ></DocCardList>

```

Under the **Utilities** section, **onReady** empowers you to execute code precisely when your Webflow site loads, while **navigate** facilitates programmatic navigation. For dynamic component creation, **createComponent** is your API of choice.

```mdx-code-block

<DocCardList items={[
       {
          type: "category",
          label: "Utilities",
          description:"🛠️ Simplifying development tasks",
          items: [{
